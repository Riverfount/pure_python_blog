# Pure Ppython Bblog

## A simple pure python blog to improve my knowledge in Python 

The main goal of this repository is to study Python to develop a web application without any framework or external library just using built-in functions and classes of Python itself.

We'll follow these steps:

- create a database integration with SQLite that has a native Python integration;
- create templates for our HTML files that will be generated by our render script;
- create a render template script, this script catches the data on the database and mixes it with the HTML template to generate a respective HTML file. This script needs to be executed before publishing our website pages.
- create a simple server WSGI script that serves dynamically the HTML pages. With this simple server, we don't need to render the pages of our websites before publishing, but these pages will be generated dynamically.
